Generated: {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}

[DONE] Completed:
✅ Phase 1 Socket Foundation - **100% WORKING** 
✅ Fixed API route mounting issues (404 errors completely resolved)
✅ Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in backend server
✅ Fixed frontend styling issues (white text on white background)
✅ Added complete real-time messaging system with global chat
✅ Fixed socket authentication errors with enhanced debugging
✅ End-to-end real-time communication validated between browsers
✅ Two browsers can connect and communicate (CORE PHASE 1 GOAL ACHIEVED)

✅ Multiple browsers can login as different users simultaneously
✅ Real-time messaging works instantly between browsers  
✅ User presence tracking (join/leave notifications working)
✅ Clean authentication flow without errors
✅ Socket connections stable and reliable
✅ Debug tools functional for connection testing

[NEXT] Phase 2 Priorities:
🎯 1. **Game Board Component**: Create 5x5 grid with word cards
🎯 2. **Team Assignment**: Implement Red/Blue team system  
🎯 3. **Role Management**: Spymaster vs Field Operative roles
🎯 4. **Game Mechanics**: Card revealing, clue giving, turn management
🎯 5. **Win Conditions**: First team to find all agents wins

[FILES] Foundation Ready:
📁 **Backend**: Rock-solid server with API, sockets, and messaging (backend/src/index.ts)
📁 **Frontend**: Complete auth and real-time communication (frontend/src/)
📁 **Components**: ChatRoom component working (frontend/src/components/Chat/)

**Previous Sessions:**

Session Summary #1
[DONE] Completed:
✅ Session Workflow System: Created comprehensive session management procedures
✅ Directory Mapping Tool: Fixed Windows encoding issues and created working structure mapper
✅ Claude Instructions: Created standardized startup instructions file
✅ Documentation: Updated SESSION_WORKFLOW.md, development_plan.md, README.md
✅ Process Improvement: Established file management and project knowledge procedures
[WIP] Current Status:
🔧 Phase 1: Socket Foundation implementation is done but needs debugging
🔧 Backend: All Phase 1 backend code is implemented and appears solid
🔧 Issues: Login input autocomplete + API connection problems need frontend debugging
[NEXT] Next Session Priorities:
🎯 1. Map Project Structure: Run python python/directory_mapper.py first thing
🎯 2. Debug Frontend Issues: Fix login input autocomplete and API connection
🎯 3. Test Real-Time Communication: Validate socket connections between browsers
[FILES] Files Ready:
📁 Backend Phase 1 implementation complete (server.ts, auth.ts, socketHandlers.ts)
📁 Session workflow tools ready (directory_mapper.py, session procedures)
📁 Frontend files need to be mapped and reviewed
[ISSUE] Issues:
🚨 Need Frontend Files: Must map structure first to request correct frontend files
🚨 Login Problems: Input autocomplete + API connection issues blocking Phase 1 completion
🚨 No Actual Development: This session was workflow setup, need development progress next

Session Summary #0
✅ Completed:
Phase 0: Project Foundation - Complete ✅
Phase 1: Socket Foundation - Implementation complete, but needs debugging
🔧 Current Status:
Backend and frontend servers are running
Socket.io infrastructure is implemented
Authentication system is built
Issue: Login input has autocomplete problems + login API not connecting
🎯 Next Session Priorities:
Fix login input field - Already have the fix script ready
Debug API connection issues - Need to check browser console & backend logs
Test real-time communication - Once login works
Commit Phase 1 - When everything works
Start Phase 2: Core Game Logic - Implement actual Codenames gameplay
📁 Files Ready:
All Phase 1 backend/frontend code is implemented
Fix script for login input is ready to run
Debugging steps are documented
See you next session to get Phase 1 fully working! 🚀
The foundation is solid - just need to iron out these connection issues and we'll be ready for the fun part (actual game implementation).
