# Codenames Web App - Development Plan

## Overview
This development plan prioritizes getting real-time multiplayer working early to validate the core technical architecture and avoid building throwaway code. The approach focuses on building a "vertical slice" through the entire stack before expanding features.

## Core Strategy
- **Socket-first development**: Real-time communication from day one
- **Vertical slice approach**: Build end-to-end functionality incrementally
- **Early risk mitigation**: Tackle the most technically challenging aspects first
- **No throwaway code**: All development contributes to the final product

## Development Workflow

### Daily Routine
1. **Morning**: Check Git status, plan specific tasks for the day
2. **Development**: Focus on one feature at a time, commit frequently
3. **Evening**: Commit progress, push to remote, update status

### Commit Strategy
- **Frequency**: At least daily, ideally after each working feature
- **Quality**: Each commit should represent a working state
- **Messages**: Clear, descriptive commit messages with scope
- **Branches**: Feature branches for larger changes, direct commits for small fixes

### Testing Approach
- **Manual Testing**: Test with multiple browser windows/devices regularly
- **Automated Testing**: Add tests for critical game logic
- **Integration Testing**: Test socket events and state synchronization
- **User Testing**: Get feedback from friends/family during development

### Risk Management
- **Technical Risks**: Socket complexity, state synchronization issues
- **Mitigation**: Start simple, build incrementally, test constantly
- **Fallback Plans**: Have simpler alternatives ready for complex features
- **Scope Management**: Cut features if behind schedule, focus on core gameplay

## Technical Priorities

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Socket.io over Server-Sent Events**: Better bidirectional communication
2. **Server-authoritative game state**: Prevents cheating, ensures consistency
3. **JWT authentication**: Simple, stateless authentication
4. **PostgreSQL**: Reliable data persistence for rooms and users

### Performance Considerations
- **Real-time updates**: Minimize unnecessary data transfer
- **Connection management**: Handle disconnections gracefully
- **Scalability**: Design for multiple concurrent games
- **Memory management**: Clean up completed games and disconnected players

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the stack
- **Prisma**: Type-safe database operations
- **Vite**: Fast frontend development
- **Jest**: Testing framework for backend logic

This plan prioritizes delivering a working multiplayer experience as quickly as possible while building a solid foundation for future features.
