- **Socket Events**: Game events functional but need refinement
- **UI Components**: Game board and card rendering complete
- **Game State Loading**: Backend not properly sending initial game state to frontend

**❌ BLOCKERS:**
- Game page shows loading spinner indefinitely - backend not sending game state
- Frontend/backend game state synchronization broken
- Actual game mechanics untested (card revealing, clues, win conditions)

### 📂 **Key Files Implemented:**
- `backend/src/models/Game.ts` - Complete Codenames game logic
- `backend/src/services/gameService.ts` - Game state management
- `backend/src/socket/socketHandlers.ts` - Socket event handlers
- `frontend/src/components/GameBoard/GameBoard.tsx` - Main game interface
- `frontend/src/components/GameBoard/Card.tsx` - Game card component
- `frontend/src/services/gameService.ts` - Frontend game service
- `shared/types/game.ts` - Game type definitions

### 🎯 **Next Session Goals:**
1. **Homepage Design**: Create clean UI for game creation/joining flow
2. **Create Game Flow**: Generate game codes and route users to new games
3. **Join Game Flow**: Validate game codes and route users to existing games
4. **Game State Fix**: Repair backend game state transmission (if time permits)
5. **Game Logic Testing**: Test actual Codenames mechanics end-to-end (future priority)

**Note**: Room = Game (simplified architecture focus)

### 💡 **Technical Architecture Ready:**
- ✅ Real-time multiplayer foundation (Socket.io)
- ⚠️ Complete game rule implementation (needs testing)
- ✅ Type-safe frontend/backend communication
- ✅ Game-based architecture (room = game)
- ✅ Authentication and user management
