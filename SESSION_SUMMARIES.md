Session Summary #0
✅ Completed:

Phase 0: Project Foundation - Complete ✅
Phase 1: Socket Foundation - Implementation complete, but needs debugging

🔧 Current Status:

Backend and frontend servers are running
Socket.io infrastructure is implemented
Authentication system is built
Issue: Login input has autocomplete problems + login API not connecting

🎯 Next Session Priorities:

Fix login input field - Already have the fix script ready
Debug API connection issues - Need to check browser console & backend logs
Test real-time communication - Once login works
Commit Phase 1 - When everything works
Start Phase 2: Core Game Logic - Implement actual Codenames gameplay

📁 Files Ready:

All Phase 1 backend/frontend code is implemented
Fix script for login input is ready to run
Debugging steps are documented

See you next session to get Phase 1 fully working! 🚀
The foundation is solid - just need to iron out these connection issues and we'll be ready for the fun part (actual game implementation).

Session Summary #1
[DONE] Completed:
✅ Session Workflow System: Created comprehensive session management procedures
✅ Directory Mapping Tool: Fixed Windows encoding issues and created working structure mapper
✅ Claude Instructions: Created standardized startup instructions file
✅ Documentation: Updated SESSION_WORKFLOW.md, development_plan.md, README.md
✅ Process Improvement: Established file management and project knowledge procedures
[WIP] Current Status:
🔧 Phase 1: Socket Foundation implementation is done but needs debugging
🔧 Backend: All Phase 1 backend code is implemented and appears solid
🔧 Issues: Login input autocomplete + API connection problems need frontend debugging
[NEXT] Next Session Priorities:
🎯 1. Map Project Structure: Run python python/directory_mapper.py first thing
🎯 2. Debug Frontend Issues: Fix login input autocomplete and API connection
🎯 3. Test Real-Time Communication: Validate socket connections between browsers
[FILES] Files Ready:
📁 Backend Phase 1 implementation complete (server.ts, auth.ts, socketHandlers.ts)
📁 Session workflow tools ready (directory_mapper.py, session procedures)
📁 Frontend files need to be mapped and reviewed
[ISSUE] Issues:
🚨 Need Frontend Files: Must map structure first to request correct frontend files
🚨 Login Problems: Input autocomplete + API connection issues blocking Phase 1 completion
🚨 No Actual Development: This session was workflow setup, need development progress next

For Next Session: Copy instructions from CLAUDE_SESSION_INSTRUCTIONS.md when starting, run directory mapper first, then get into actual Phase 1 debugging! 🚀
